Remotely-Controlled Catapult
===========================================================================================
The objective of this project is to apply the fundamentals of embedded systems design to develop a remotely-controlled catapult, launching and reloading small-scale projectiles via web interface. The catapult project will fulfill a need to effectively reduce user intervention, with no need to reload, manually retract, or lock the catapult arm into place, but will only be required to fill the catapult with ammunition when it is empty. This is made possible by applying the latest technologies in software development, while emphasizing on an Internet-connected device.

Device Construction
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Arduino Ethernet Shield 2 is compatible with any Arduino board, so the Ethernet Shield male header pins should fit perfectly with the female header pins of the Arduino UNO REV3, just make sure that the male header pins arenâ€™t bent when exerting force down on the Ethernet Shield to attach it to the Arduino board.
